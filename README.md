# Todo-App
A simple todo app to help you to remember what you want to do.

## **Overview**
As part of Kalbonyan Almarsos program and The Modern JavaScript Bootcamp by Andrew Mead, I've built a simple todo app, 
a web app that can be used to create and save todos to help you to remember what you want to do.

[The Modern JavaScript Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript/) on Udemy.

## **Tools**
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript / ES6

## **Features**
- Add new todo.
- Filter your todos.
- Mark as completed todo.
- Hide completed todos.
- Remove a todo.
- Count of all todos you have.
- Auto store your todos after done (Local Storage).

To get the application up and running locally, run these commands:
```
npm i
npm run dev-server
```
